# GURPS Tools

Welcome my GURPS Tools!
The Generic Universal Role Playing System is one of my personal favorites, but
it's also notoriously complex. So I've put my skills to work making game aids
that can help out with some of the more intricate systems.

# Damage Calculator

Solve your layered armor problems.  This tool helps with complex layered armor
setups: think if you've got a character with a Sci-Fi shield, layered over your
ablative ceramic plate armor, layered over a balistic-weave skin suit. For a
human, this would take a few seconds, but this site takes all of the
calculations and just haldles it!

# Help, I need a tool!

This is a collection of tools that _I_ have needed and created, but I'm just one
GM who sometimes runs several different genres. If you've got a tool that you
need, and want me to make it let me know! Check out my Contact info on the
[About page](/about).
