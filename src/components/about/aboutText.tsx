# About this App

g-damage-calc is a damage calculator built to help me calculate the complex
interactions of damage, armor, and armor reduction (or ablation) without having
to do it all in my head. If you find yourself playing games that need this kind
of a tool, try it out.

GURPS is a trademark of Steve Jackson Games, and its rules and art are copyrighted by Steve Jackson Games. All rights are reserved by Steve Jackson Games. This game aid is the original creation of Jon Yocky and is released for free distribution, and not for resale, under the permissions granted in the [Steve Jackson Games Online Policy](http://www.sjgames.com/general/online_policy.html).

This app is not endorsed by Steve Jackson Games, nor is there any warranty on
it's compatibility with the GURPS system or any other gaming system. This app is
designed to be a play-aid for GURPS, specifically Ultra-Tech. If you're running
high-powered space marines with layered defences and a myriad of
countermeasures, you may have run into a similar problem I did when calculating
exactly how much damage your heroes are taking. I may expand this app's
functionality beyond GURPS to other play systems in the future.

The app is written with React and is open-source. If you have any issues or
additions you'd like to see with this app please let me know with an email,
issue (for a bug), or a Pull Request (if you're ambitious)!`;
