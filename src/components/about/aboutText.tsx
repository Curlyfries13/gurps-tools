# About this Site

This site is a place where I'll put tools that I have needed or wanted when
playing Steve Jackson's GURPS.

## Damage Calculator
This calculator is a tool to speed up play with  the complex interactions of
damage, armor, and armor reduction (or ablation) without having to do it all in
my head or with pen and paper. If you find yourself playing games that need this
kind of a tool, try it out.

This app is not endorsed by Steve Jackson Games, nor is there any warranty on
it's compatibility with the GURPS system or any other gaming system. This app is
designed to be a play-aid for GURPS, specifically Ultra-Tech. If you're running
high-powered space marines with layered defences and a myriad of
countermeasures, you may have run into a similar problem I did when calculating
exactly how much damage your heroes (or mooks) are taking. I may expand this
app's functionality beyond GURPS to other play systems in the future.

# About Me
I'm Jon, a GURPS GM and a web developer. I've been playing GURPS since 2015, and
I've played, built, and run games in loads of worlds: Alternate History American
1800's, dystopian Sci-fi with world jumpping, Medival fantasy, Pulp Sci-Fi,
Steampunk, Pirates, Space Opera, you name it. I find GURPS to be a gernerally
simple game with some very complicated corners. Usually, it's an easy system but
when you get into the nitty-grity (how many pounds can I _actually_ lift, how
much damage does this do after running through 3 other sources of contact, how
likely am I to hit something on the other side of a semi-permiable barrier, can
I use this thing as a weapon and how badly would it damage it) GURPS not only
gives you the tools to figure these things out, but also provides a shovel to
dig your own grave.

So if you're like me, and you _like_ the details that GURPS provides but you
also want to be able to actually finish a game session in a reasonable amount of
time, you'll need some help. Hopefully this site can help out there.
